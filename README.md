*The mobile header is not animating in when someone clicks the hamburger button, can you fix that?*
<br />
I wasn't able to completely fix the hamburger menu. 
I added an onclick event listener in JS:

<br />
And added styles to display and animate:

<br />
However, while the hamburger menu animates as expected, it disapeares after the animation. 
I looked into jQuery conflicts, and using the chrome inspect tool I tried to observe any styles overriding the intended behaviour. However I was not able to completely fix the mobile navbar.

*We want a different logo in the footer, can you make it so we can add our own  easily?*
<br />
I added a widget to the footer.php:

*I tried making a change to the product page and it stopped loading? It should display a product name, a product description and the price*
<br />
I changed the spelling of the function for description:

*We have a custom Elementor widget that just went missing on the homepage, can you restore it? (This is a tough one, we donâ€™t expect you to get this one)*
<br />
I was able to get this to display using the admin dashboard:
